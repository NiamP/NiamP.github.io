        The Growth of ESG Investment and its Impact
    </h1>

<hr>
<h2>Aims</h2>
<p>This project explores the growth and impact of ESG investment practices on markets, companies and the wider world. The rise in global temperatures and the increasing effects of climate change have prompted investors to prioritise investments that align with ESG values. Over the past decade, ESG investing has become a key focus for capital allocators, which has led to discussion around its effectiveness and whether sustainability comes at the detriment of profit. This project examines the evolution of ESG investing, tries to find a correlation between ESG and company performance metrics and evaluates whether an increasing emphasis on ESG has had any tangible impact on the world.</p>

<h2 class = "underlined">What Are Sources of ESG Investment?</h2>

    <section>
        <p>First, I want to look at where ESG Investment is coming from, and whether there has really been a growth in the value of sustainable investments.</p>
        <div id = "chartGrid">
        <figure>
            <div id = "LocationA"></div> 
            <p>I tried to fetch ESG data for 15,000 mutual funds but was only returned with roughly 4000 valid responses. yfinance doesnt return a country so I used a dictionary I found to map the exchanges of these funds to their home country and graphed the location of the top 500.</p>
            <a href="https://github.com/NiamP/NiamP.github.io/blob/main/GetESGData.py" class ="button-link">Code to get this data</a>
        </figure>
        <figure>
            <div id = "LocationF"></div>
            <p>The data for this chart was downloaded from a Statista analysis of the rapid growth of the ESG sector since 2019.</p>
        </figure>
        </div>
        <p>We can see that the US dominates in Sustainable mutual funds which is expected given they have the most funds overall. We can also see that the value of ESG ETFs has jumped massively since 2018, which will hopefully correlate to some tangible change.</p>

<h2 class = "underlined">What Are The Returns From This ESG Investment</h2>

    <section>
        <p>Now, examining the returns from this ESG investment, I looked at the performance of top ESG mutual funds, and the ESG counterpart to the largest index in the world, the S&P 500.</p>
        <div id = "chartGrid">
        <figure>
            <div id = "LocationB"></div>
            <p>This chart shows the performance of the top 5 ranked ESG Mutual Funds that have existed at any point since 2020 (whether active or not). The data within this chart is updated daily from the yfinance API using GitHub actions.</p>
            <a href= "https://github.com/NiamP/NiamP.github.io/blob/main/_ESGManipulation.py" class ="button-link">Code to get this data</a>
        </figure>
        <figure>
            <div id = "LocationC"></div>
            <p>This figure shows the performance of the S&P 500 against its ESG counterpart, and I created a red line to show the difference at any given time.</p>
        </figure>
        </div>
        <p>Whilst we can see that the mutual funds may not have performed well, with 3 already shut down, if we look at the larger sample, we see that actually, the S&P 500 ESG has performed better than the traditional Index. This disproves the idea that returns from ESG investments will never match traditional investments.</p>

<h2 class = "underlined">Are ESG Performance and Company Performance Mutually Exclusive?</h2>

    <section>
        <p>Next, I examine whether there are any patterns between the companies in these portfolios' performance and their ESG score.</p>
        <div id = "chartGrid">
        <figure>
            <div id = "LocationD"></div>
            <p>I gathered ESG and market cap data from the yfinance API and, using Github actions, made sure that the data is updated each day</p>
            <a href="https://github.com/NiamP/NiamP.github.io/blob/main/MarketCapvsESG.py" class="button-link">Code to get this data</a>
        </figure>
        <figure>
            <div id = "LocationG"></div>
            <p>This LOESS regression of Revenue Growth on ESG risk score also uses data from the yfinance API which is also updated each day.</p>
            <a href="https://github.com/NiamP/NiamP.github.io/blob/main/LoessRegression.ipynb" class = "button-link">Code to get this data</a>
        </figure>
        </div>
        <p>Although we can see that ESG score and market cap aren't correlated, there is a relationship between year-on-year revenue growth and ESG risk score. Although the relationship isn't linear, it does show that companies with poor ESG risk score perform worse than companies in the 10-30 range.</p>

<h2 class = "underlined">So What Are the Results of This Investment?</h2>
    <section>
        <p>Finally, I want to examine whether any of this investment or emphasis on ESG has had any real impact on the world</p>
        <figure>
            <h3>Map of Global Carbon Emissions Since 1900</h3>
            <h5>Source: Our World in Data API</h6>
            <iframe id="LocationH" src="Emissionsmap.html" width = 1000 height = 600 frameborder ="0"></iframe>
            <p>This graph maps global emissions for each year since 1900 using data using Python's Plotly package.</p>
            <a href= "https://github.com/NiamP/NiamP.github.io/blob/main/CarbonMap.ipynb" class = "button-link">Link To Python File in GitHub</a>
        </figure>
    </section>
        <figure>
            <div id="LocationE"></div>
            <p>This box plot shows pre 2030 Emissions reduction targets for companies across a variety of sectors. The data shows that companies across sectors are setting challenging targets with most sectors having a median between 40 and 50 percent.</p>
            <a href="https://github.com/NiamP/NiamP.github.io/blob/main/Boxplottargets.ipynb" class = "button-link">Code to get this Data</a>
        </figure>
        <p>These two graphs present a positive picture. They both suggest that there is an effort being made to reduce emissions and protect the environment. The map shows that the spike in ESG-related investing seems to align with western emissions falling. However, China's huge and rising emissions are concerning.</p>
    </section>
<hr>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>Gathering data from yahoo finance presented challenges as data often wasnt available which would break my code. Secondly Plotly does not natively support custom keys with animations, which required me to find a workaround to 'trick' plotly into holding the key I wanted throughout the animation without affecting the map.</p>
<hr>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<hr>
<p>It is clear from the above analysis that ESG investing has had an influence on the financial landscape, driving an increase in awareness of sustainability in investment. The graphs paint a positive picture of an increase in ESG related funds, challenging targets being set by companies and positive performance of ESG related companies and investments. However, the true impact of these changes will take years to fully materialise.</p>
<p>While ESG investing is clearly having a positive impact by reducing emissions (especially in the west) its benefits have been largely offset by countries like China, who's emissions are still rising. Therefore, a more global effort will be needed to increase ESG investment and reduce total emissions production worldwide to slow down climate change.</p>
