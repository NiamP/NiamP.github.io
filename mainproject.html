        The Growth of ESG Investment and its Impact
    </h1>

<hr>
<h2>Aims</h2>
<p>This project explores the growth and impact of ESG investment practices on markets, companies and the wider world. The rise in global temperatures and the increasing effects of climate change have prompted investors to prioritise investments that align with ESG values. Over the past decade ESG investing has become a key focus for capital allocators, which has led to discussion around its effectiveness and whether sustainability comes at the detriment of profit. This project examines the evolution of ESG investing, tries to find correlation between ESG and company performance metrics and evaluates whether an increasing emphasis on ESG has actually had any tangible impact on the world.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p>1. The yfinance API is an API that allows users to fetch financial data from Yahoo Finance</p>
<p>2. Yahoo Finance makes use of ESG scores from Sustainalytics. ESG scores for mutual funds are based on their portfolios. The way the scoring system works means that the lower the value, the lower the unmitigated ESG risks the company poses (i.e the better) so companies with a lower score are essentially more sustainable than companies with a larger score.</p>

            <p>I attempted to fetch ESG data on the top 15,000 mutual funds using the yfinance API and stored the returned values in a pandas dataframe. I also stored the exchange that they are traded on and, using a dictionary I found online, mapped these exchanges to their country of origin. From here I ordered the Funds by ESG score and graphed the Location of the top 500. As we can see the vast majority of Funds are in the US. This is expected though, as the US has significantly more actively managed funds than any other country worldwide. Interestingly, however, the UK is notably absent from this list.</p>

            <p>This scatter plot compares ESG risk score and market cap for the companies that make up the S&P 500. The data for this graph comes from Yahoo finance and is updated daily to ensure accuracy. As we can see there seems to be no correlation between Market cap and ESG risk score, which is surprising given that we may expect large Market cap companies to be spending more on aligning themselves more closely with ESG standards. </p>

            <p>This scatter plot shows a LOESS regression (non linear) of Revenue Growth on ESG risk score. The data for this chart is updated daily, but at the time of writing, it seems that companies with extremely low ESG risk scores (very good) and extremely high ESG risk scores (very bad) seem to have low or negative Revenue growth. Whilst companies in the 10-30 Range seem to be performing positively.</p>

            <p>This box plot shows target Emissions reductions across a variety of sectors for companies that submitted targets to SBTi for their report. There were over 1000 companies who set targets with SBTi, and this has almost doubled from the previous year which was 587. The data shows that companies across sectors are setting challenging emissions reductions targets with most sectors having a median somewhere between 40 and 50 percent. Almost every industry had at least 1 company targeting 100% emissions reductions, these targets are all set for 2030 or earlier, which if they are fulfilled will have a huge impact on global emissions production, and the hope is that as ESG practices continue to grow, more companies will begin setting emissions reductions targets.</p>

            <p>This graph maps global emissions for each year since 1900 using data from our world in data API. The graph shows that whilst emissions had been steadily increasing since 1900, since 2019 many developed countries such as the US, UK, France and Spain have all seen decreases in total emissions since 2019, this corresponds to the same time period in which assets in ESG ETFs began to rapidly increase. While this correlation may not necessarily indicate causation it is an interesting insight. However whilst many western developed nations have seen reductions in emissions, the benefits have been partially offset by countries such as China and Russia whose emissions have continued to climb, especially China which now emits 11B tonnes of Emissions each year, which is even more extraordinary when comparing this figure to India, which emits just 3 Billion with a comparable population size.</p>

<h2>Data And Analytical Challenges</h2>
<hr>
<p>The largest challenge in collecting the data for this project was the issue of paywalls. Much of the useful ESG data that exists is proprietary and used by institutional investors at banks and hedge funds, making it inaccessible for me working on a university project. To get around this, I made use of free data sources such as Yahoo Finance using the yfinance API, as well as data from Statista, the Science-Based Targets Monitoring report and Our World In Data API. However these sources presented their own challenges, especially collecting company data from Yahoo Finance, where some companies had available ESG data whilst others did not, which required fetching a huge pool of data and then filtering out companies that didn't have available metrics before applying the data to my visualisations. In the case of the Science-Based Targets Monitoring Report and Statista, the data was available only as Excel or CSV download files, so for these sources I just had to download and modify the data in python before uploading it to github to use in Vega Lite.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In terms of data preprocessing, the charts from yahoo finance, especially the revenue growth and location charts as well as the box plot of SBTi were the most difficult, as these all required a lot of manipulation in pandas to become useable inside of Vega Lite. In terms of creating the visualisation, the map was the most difficult, as I had very little experience using plotly and so had to rely on its documentation to allow me to build the animation. Furthermore building the custom key is not native to plotlys map function especially when using animations. Therefore plotly would make the scale of the key dynamic meaning it would change on each animation frame essentially rednering the colours useless, this required me to use python to include dummy data in my csv which allowed me to essenetially 'trick' plotly into holding a constant key throughout the animation whilst not altering any of the data visible on the map.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The other data sourced from the yfinance API also required some pre-processing, with the yfinance API not offering country of origin as a part of its service, I was required to download and use a dictionary relating market indexes to their country of origin, this allowed me to pair the market that a company or fund was traded on to see what country it was based in. I also used Vega-Lite to perform some of the analysis, using the built in Loess regression on my data within the Vega editor.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Automation</h2>
<hr>
<p>I aimed to use APIs as much as possible in this project, as these allow for reusability. For some of the visualisations, including the Top 5 Mutual Funds graph, Scatter Plot and Regression Plot I made use of GitHub actions, and so at midnight each day my python script which fetches the data for these plots is run and the data displayed on the visualisations on the site is updated. This means that for the more volatile data, such as market caps and prices, the website will remain accurate and relevant at all times.</p>
    
<hr>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<hr>
<p>The visualisations demonstrate that ESG investing and practices are growing in importance, with the value of assets in ESG ETFs continuing to rise. It is also clear that companies are taking steps to reduce their carbon emissions and align themselves more closely with a sustainable future. While the carbon emissions goals are impressive, the overall impact of these efforts will not be fully realized until a greater proportion of firms are setting these targets.</p>
<p>However, we can see that companies with strong ESG scores within the S&P 500 have outperformed the standard index, which disproves the notion that in order to achieve sustainability comapnies have to give up on profits, furthermore whilst many of the companies with extremely low ESG risk scores had negative revenue growth, companies in the 10-20 range performed much better than those in the 30+ range, which again goes to show that monetary performance and sustainability are not mutually exclusive, which gives rise to the opportunity for comapnies to improve their ESG scores without the need to worry what adverse affects it might have on their revenues</p>
<p>The map also clearly shows that many western developed nations such as the USA, UK and France  have made efforts to reduce their emissions in the past 5 years. However, eastern countries such as China and Russia have continued to increase their Emissions during this period. Therefore in order for any meaningful progress to occur in slowing the rate of climate change, these eastern Economies will need to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels and therefore reduce their total Emissions.</p>
